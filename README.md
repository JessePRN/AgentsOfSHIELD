# Did Covid force a migration from urban counties to rural counties in Georgia?

## Project Overview

Covid-19 has changed the world in nearly every way. The lockdowns and the cease of non-essential services further add to the negative attributes of living in cities. Additionally, reports of exodus from huge urban centers like New York City and San Francisco to more rural parts of the United States.  Is this sentiment true in Georgia? Can we look at the population data from the US Census to confirm or deny that people in Georgia are also fleeing the urban counties for the rural counties? 

## Project Structure


The final code for this project is found in :

Our group used two sets of census data from the US Census which are in the Census Folder.

The graphs and tables are in plots_tables folder within the Census Folder.

The heatmap are in Heatmap folder within the Census Folder

## Observations:


**Population change:**

•	Fulton county has a massive population of 1 million plus.

•	The 9 other counties combined is just over 800,000 people.

•	Log scale is necessary to look at the smaller populations under 200,000. 

•	Most counties have a slight uptick in population from 2020 to 2021

**% Change**

•	2020 overall has the biggest % change across the 11-year period.

•	Counties either have big jumps or dips.

•	Biggest jump is 6.64%.

•	Biggest dip is -3.98%.

**Population changes for Fulton and Chatham**

•	R-value for both counties are very high, almost right at 1.

**% Change for Fulton and Chatham**

•	R- value are above .5 threshold so the fit is pretty good.

•	The rate of change sharply declined for Fulton after Covid.

•	Chatham saw an uptick followed by a decline in the following year.

**Population changes for Grady and Worth**

•	R-value for Grady is low due to the big jump in population from 2020 and 2021. Otherwise, the overall trend would be a declining population. 

•	R- value for Worth is close to -1 and the trend of declining population is maintained. Covid did give a slight uptick, but declining trend continued in following year. 

**% change for Grady and Worth**

•	R-value for both counties are low, but this is due to the spike in increase of population during 2020. If the 2020 numbers are excluded, the trendline would fit the datapoints better.


## Conclusions:


•	The box and whiskers plot for the population change shows that there is no statistical difference between the years pre and post covid. 

•	The % change box and whiskers plot also shows that there is no statistical difference between the years pre and post covid.
